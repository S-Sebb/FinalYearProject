{"text": "Apraclonidine appears safe and efficacious.\nIt significantly lowered IOP when used in combination with a patient's maximum tolerated medical therapy.\nThis delayed or prevented further glaucoma surgery for at least 90 days in approximately 60% of treated patients.", "label": []}
{"text": "Recruitment has been successfully completed in this prospective study and the design and baseline results are presented.", "label": []}
{"text": "Dorzolamide demonstrated significant IOP lowering activity over 4 weeks.\nIt was well tolerated and there were no clinically significant changes in ocular or systemic safety parameters.", "label": []}
