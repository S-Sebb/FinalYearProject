287,Patients randomized to initial medication received a stepped medical regimen (n = 307). Those randomized to initial surgery underwent a trabeculectomy (n = 300). The baseline interview was conducted before treatment initiation. All baseline and posttreatment QOL assessments were conducted by telephone from a centralized interviewing center.,METHODS
288,"The primary endpoint was time for resolution of DKA (pH ≥7.3, bicarbonate ≥15 mEq/L, beta-hydroxybutyrate <1 mmol/L). Secondary outcomes were the rate of fall in blood glucose until 250 mg/dL or less and the rate of complications (hypokalemia, hypoglycemia, and cerebral edema).",METHODS

290,Study patients were randomized to undergo placement of a 350-mm(2) Baerveldt glaucoma implant or trabeculectomy with mitomycin C (0.4 mg/ml for 4 minutes).,METHODS
291,"Selenium or vitamin E, alone or in combination at the doses and formulations used, did not prevent prostate cancer in this population of relatively healthy men.",CONCLUSIONS
292,"A double-blind, randomised controlled study.",METHODS
293,Recruitment has been successfully completed in this prospective study and the design and baseline results are presented.,CONCLUSIONS
294,"Baseline age, vertical C/D ratio, vertical C/D ratio asymmetry, and PSD were good predictors of the onset of OAG in the EGPS. Central corneal thickness was found to be a powerful predictor of the development of OAG. The EGPS results agree with the findings of the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study and support the need for a thorough evaluation of patients with ocular hypertension.",CONCLUSIONS

299,"Average percent of eyes with decrease of visual field (APDVF), average percent of eyes with decrease of visual acuity (APDVA), and average percent of eyes with decrease of vision (APDV) are the outcome measures. Decrease of visual field (DVF) is an increase from baseline of at least 4 points on a glaucoma visual field defect scale ranging from 0 to 20, decrease of visual acuity (DVA) is a decrease from baseline of at least 15 letters (3 lines), and decrease of vision (DV) is the occurrence of either DVF or DVA. The averages are of percent decreases observed at 6-month intervals from the first 6-month visit to the end of the specified observation period.",METHODS
300,": Briefly, the eligibility criteria included 1) participants between the ages of 35 and 70 yrs, 2) candidates of lobectomy for non-small cell lung cancer, and 3) the first elective surgery of the day. Sixty-six patients were enrolled in the study.",METHODS
