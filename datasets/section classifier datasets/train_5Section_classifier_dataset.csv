13,"In total, 394 patients were enrolled and 364 were eligible, with a median (range) age of 55 (25-70) years. There were 202 (55.5%) male and 162 (44.5%) female patients. The median follow-up was 46.0 (95% CI, 41.9-51.4) months, and 230 DFS events were reported. There were 184 patients in the PORT arm and 180 patients in the observation arm. The 3-year DFS rates were 40.5% with PORT vs 32.7% with observation (median, 22.1 vs 18.6 months), and the difference in DFS was not statistically significant without adjustment (hazard ratio [HR], 0.84; 95% CI, 0.65-1.09; P = .20), though it was significant with preplanned yet exploratory analysis (stratified analysis by the number of detected lymph nodes and positive lymph nodes, HR, 0.75; log-rank P = .04).

Fifty-three patients (27.9%) had unilateral field loss. The 137 patients with bilateral field loss were older than those with unilateral field loss: 65.7 versus 62.3 years of age (P<0.05). Mean untreated diurnal intraocular pressures were similar between the eyes of the bilateral patients (mean, 15.5 mmHg in both eyes) and unilateral patients (mean, 16.0 mmHg in field loss vs. 15.6 mmHg in fellow eyes). Visual field mean deviation for all eyes was -5.4+/-4.7 decibels. Central corneal thickness in 168 phakic patients was 543 +/- 35 microm (range, 435-655 microm); thickness was less than 500 microm in 15 eyes and was more than 600 microm in 11 eyes. Mean vertical cup-to-disc ratio for all eyes was 0.67+/-0.15.

When operating on an infant younger than 7 months of age with a unilateral cataract, we recommend leaving the eye aphakic and focusing the eye with a contact lens. Primary IOL implantation should be reserved for those infants where, in the opinion of the surgeon, the cost and handling of a contact lens would be so burdensome as to result in significant periods of uncorrected aphakia.",CONCLUSIONS

1180,"For eyes without PDR at baseline, the 3-year cumulative probabilities for retinopathy worsening (P value comparison with sham with prompt laser) were 23% using sham with prompt laser, 18% with ranibizumab with prompt laser (P = .25), 7% with ranibizumab with deferred laser (P = .001), and 37% with triamcinolone with prompt laser (P = .10). For eyes with PDR at baseline, the 3-year cumulative probabilities for retinopathy worsening were 40%, 21% (P = .05), 18% (P = .02), and 12% (P < .001), respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Intravitreal ranibizumab appears to be associated with a reduced risk of diabetic retinopathy worsening in eyes with or without PDR. Intravitreal triamcinolone also appears to be associated with a reduced risk of PDR worsening. These findings suggest that use of these drugs to prevent worsening of diabetic retinopathy may be feasible. Given the exploratory nature of these analyses, the risk of endophthalmitis following intravitreal injections, and the fact that intravitreal triamcinolone can cause cataract or glaucoma, use of these treatments to reduce the rates of worsening of retinopathy, with or without PDR, does not seem warranted at this time.",RESULTS

1195,"The ophthalmic drug showed potential for the non-surgical treatment of age-related cataracts for participants after controlling for age, gender and daily activities and on a combined basis of repurchases behavior reports in more than 50,000 various cohort survivors, has been demonstrated to have a high efficacy and good tolerability for prevention and treatment of visual impairment determined for the older population with relative stable pattern of causes for blindness and visual impairment. The mechanisms of prevention and reversal of cataracts with NAC ophthalmic drug are considered which include prevention by the intraocular released carnosine of free-radical-induced inactivation of proprietary lens antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase); prevention of carbohydrate and metal-catalyzed autooxidation of ascorbic acid-induced cross-linking glycation reactions to the lens proteins; transglycation properties of carnosine, allowing it to compete for the glycating agent, protecting proteins (lens crystallins) against modification; universal antioxidant and scavenging activity towards lipid hydroperoxides, aldehydes and oxygen radicals; activation with l-carnosine ingredient of proteasome activity in the lens; chaperone-like disaggregating to lens crystallins activity of NAC and of its bioactivated principal carnosine. Blindness incidence increased with advancing age, such as cataract and glaucoma, which are by far the commonest causes of blindness in our sample and in all age groups, glaucomatous neurodegeneration can be treated with developed NAC autoinduction prodrug eye drops equipped with corneal absorption promoters. The common blinding affections presenting in developed countries such as, senile macular degeneration, hereditary chorioretinal dystrophies, diabetic retinopathy are poorly represented in our current summary of vital-statistics and will be reported inherent in next N-acetylcarnosine ophthalmic drug studies.",RESULTS

1200,"During the CEE plus MPA intervention phase, the numbers of CHD cases were 196 for CEE plus MPA vs 159 for placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 1.18; 95% CI, 0.95-1.45) and 206 vs 155, respectively, for invasive breast cancer (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.01-1.53). Other risks included increased stroke, pulmonary embolism, dementia (in women aged ≥65 years), gallbladder disease, and urinary incontinence; benefits included decreased hip fractures, diabetes, and vasomotor symptoms. Most risks and benefits dissipated postintervention, although some elevation in breast cancer risk persisted during cumulative follow-up (434 cases for CEE plus MPA vs 323 for placebo; HR, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.11-1.48]). The risks and benefits were more balanced during the CEE alone intervention with 204 CHD cases for CEE alone vs 222 cases for placebo (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.78-1.14) and 104 vs 135, respectively, for invasive breast cancer (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.61-1.02); cumulatively, there were 168 vs 216, respectively, cases of breast cancer diagnosed (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.65-0.97). Results for other outcomes were similar to CEE plus MPA. Neither regimen affected all-cause mortality. For CEE alone, younger women (aged 50-59 years) had more favorable results for all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and the global index (nominal P < .05 for trend by age). Absolute risks of adverse events (measured by the global index) per 10,000 women annually taking CEE plus MPA ranged from 12 excess cases for ages of 50-59 years to 38 for ages of 70-79 years; for women taking CEE alone, from 19 fewer cases for ages of 50-59 years to 51 excess cases for ages of 70-79 years.

Aqueous humor formation (microliter/minute +/- standard deviation) also was lower (P = 0.02) in dorzolamide eyes (1.79 +/- 0.4 vs. 2.33 +/- 0.5). After oral acetazolamide 250 mg, IOP was unchanged in dorzolamide eyes (17.6 +/- 2.0 preacetazolamide vs. 17.9 +/- 2.0 postacetazolamide), whereas it was reduced (P = 0.003) in control eyes (20.5 +/- 2.2 preacetazolamide vs. 16.9 +/- 2.3 postacetazolamide).
