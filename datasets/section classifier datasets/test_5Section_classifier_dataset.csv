Symptoms of NSCLC improved in 43% (95% confidence interval [CI], 33%-53%) of patients receiving 250 mg of gefitinib and in 35% (95% CI, 26%-45%) of patients receiving 500 mg. These benefits were observed within 3 weeks in 75% of patients. Partial radiographic responses occurred in 12% (95% CI, 6%-20%) of individuals receiving 250 mg of gefitinib and in 9% (95% CI, 4%-16%) of those receiving 500 mg. Symptoms improved in 96% of patients with partial radiographic responses. The overall survival at 1 year was 25%.

10,"Overall, the QOL impact reported by the two treatment groups as measured by instruments used in this study is remarkably similar, with relatively few significant study group differences observed after up to 5 years of follow-up in the CIGTS. When significant differences in visual function have been detected using the VAQ, they are consistent with the clinical outcomes. To date, the most persistent QOL finding is the increased impact of local eye symptoms reported by the surgical group compared with the medical group. Although no changes are recommended in the treatment of newly diagnosed glaucoma patients at the time of this interim report, further follow-up will allow for more definitive answers to the QOL impact of these two treatment approaches.",CONCLUSIONS

Over first 24 months, trabeculectomy-treated eyes required on average 1.1 fewer drugs than phacoemulsification-treated eyes (P<0.001).
