Symptoms of NSCLC improved in 43% (95% confidence interval [CI], 33%-53%) of patients receiving 250 mg of gefitinib and in 35% (95% CI, 26%-45%) of patients receiving 500 mg. These benefits were observed within 3 weeks in 75% of patients. Partial radiographic responses occurred in 12% (95% CI, 6%-20%) of individuals receiving 250 mg of gefitinib and in 9% (95% CI, 4%-16%) of those receiving 500 mg. Symptoms improved in 96% of patients with partial radiographic responses. The overall survival at 1 year was 25%. There were no significant differences between the 250-mg and 500-mg doses in rates of symptom improvement (P =.26), radiographic tumor regression (P =.51), and projected 1-year survival (P =.54).

10,"Overall, the QOL impact reported by the two treatment groups as measured by instruments used in this study is remarkably similar, with relatively few significant study group differences observed after up to 5 years of follow-up in the CIGTS. When significant differences in visual function have been detected using the VAQ, they are consistent with the clinical outcomes. To date, the most persistent QOL finding is the increased impact of local eye symptoms reported by the surgical group compared with the medical group. Although no changes are recommended in the treatment of newly diagnosed glaucoma patients at the time of this interim report, further follow-up will allow for more definitive answers to the QOL impact of these two treatment approaches.",CONCLUSIONS

Phacoemulsification and trabeculectomy resulted in significant and comparable IOP reduction at 24 months after surgery (reduction of 8.4 mmHg or 34% for phacoemulsification vs. 8.9 mmHg or 36% for trabeculectomy; P=0.76). Over first 24 months, trabeculectomy-treated eyes required on average 1.1 fewer drugs than phacoemulsification-treated eyes (P<0.001). However, trabeculectomy was associated with significantly more surgical complications than phacoemulsification (46% vs. 4%; P=0.001).

The median (range) follow-up was 11.9 (7.6-13.3) years. In groups A, B, and C, median (range) overall survival times were 20.5 (17.5-26.0), 19.8 (16.7-23.5), and 22.0 (18.7-26.2) months, respectively, and 10-year survival probabilities were 13.6%, 7.5%, and 15.2%, respectively. There were no significant differences in overall survival among treatment groups. The 10-year progression-free survival probabilities were 8.5%, 6.5%, and 11.1% in groups A, B, and C, respectively. Grade 3 or 4 late toxic effect rates were 3.4% (heart, 0.7%; lung, 2.7%) in group A, and those only affecting the lung represented 3.4% and 4.1% in groups B and C, respectively. No other cases of late toxic effects (grades 3/4) were observed since the initial report.",RESULTS
