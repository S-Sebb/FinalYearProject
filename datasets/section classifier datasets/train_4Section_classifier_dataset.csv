243,"At 10 am (peak drug effect) on day 28, the mean IOP reduction from baseline was significantly greater with bimatoprost (9.3 mm Hg, 40.3%) than with timolol gel (7.1 mm Hg, 31.1%; P=.024, Wilcoxon rank sum test) or latanoprost (7.4 mm Hg, 33.3%). In the overall analysis of IOP measured over the course of 24 hours, mean IOP was significantly lower with bimatoprost or latanoprost than with timolol gel (P<.001; analysis of repeated measures). The analysis of repeated measures also showed a significant difference between bimatoprost and latanoprost (P=.003). In the area-under-the-curve analysis, bimatoprost and latanoprost were superior to timolol gel (P< or =.018) but comparable to each other (P> or =.223).

The mechanisms of prevention and reversal of cataracts with NAC ophthalmic drug are considered which include prevention by the intraocular released carnosine of free-radical-induced inactivation of proprietary lens antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase); prevention of carbohydrate and metal-catalyzed autooxidation of ascorbic acid-induced cross-linking glycation reactions to the lens proteins; transglycation properties of carnosine, allowing it to compete for the glycating agent, protecting proteins (lens crystallins) against modification; universal antioxidant and scavenging activity towards lipid hydroperoxides, aldehydes and oxygen radicals; activation with l-carnosine ingredient of proteasome activity in the lens; chaperone-like disaggregating to lens crystallins activity of NAC and of its bioactivated principal carnosine. Blindness incidence increased with advancing age, such as cataract and glaucoma, which are by far the commonest causes of blindness in our sample and in all age groups, glaucomatous neurodegeneration can be treated with developed NAC autoinduction prodrug eye drops equipped with corneal absorption promoters.

576,"In the SCORE Study, triamcinolone treatment was not associated with lower incidences of neovascular events or nonperfusion status compared with observation or grid photocoagulation. Cumulative 36-month incidences for most neovascular events were significantly higher for nonperfused than perfused eyes. Greater baseline disc areas of nonperfusion increased the risk of neovascularization in BRVO but not CRVO eyes, possibly owing to obscuration of retinal capillary details caused by dense hemorrhage at baseline for CRVO eyes. Increased risk of neovascularization was noted below the historical threshold of 10 disc areas of nonperfusion for retinal vein occlusion.",CONCLUSIONS

693,"For eyes without PDR at baseline, the 3-year cumulative probabilities for retinopathy worsening (P value comparison with sham with prompt laser) were 23% using sham with prompt laser, 18% with ranibizumab with prompt laser (P = .25), 7% with ranibizumab with deferred laser (P = .001), and 37% with triamcinolone with prompt laser (P = .10). For eyes with PDR at baseline, the 3-year cumulative probabilities for retinopathy worsening were 40%, 21% (P = .05), 18% (P = .02), and 12% (P < .001), respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Intravitreal ranibizumab appears to be associated with a reduced risk of diabetic retinopathy worsening in eyes with or without PDR. Intravitreal triamcinolone also appears to be associated with a reduced risk of PDR worsening. These findings suggest that use of these drugs to prevent worsening of diabetic retinopathy may be feasible. Given the exploratory nature of these analyses, the risk of endophthalmitis following intravitreal injections, and the fact that intravitreal triamcinolone can cause cataract or glaucoma, use of these treatments to reduce the rates of worsening of retinopathy, with or without PDR, does not seem warranted at this time.",RESULTS

1176,"Late complications developed in 56 subjects (46.8 ± 4.8 5-year cumulative % ± SE) in the Ahmed Glaucoma Valve group and 67 (56.3 ± 4.7 5-year cumulative % ± SE) in the Baerveldt Glaucoma Implant group (P = .082). The cumulative rates of serious complications were 15.9% and 24.7% in the Ahmed Glaucoma Valve and Baerveldt Glaucoma Implant groups, respectively (P = .034), although this was largely driven by subjects who had tube occlusions in the 2 groups (0.8% in the Ahmed Glaucoma Valve group and 5.7% in the Baerveldt Glaucoma Implant group, P = .037). Both groups had a relatively high incidence of persistent diplopia (12%) and corneal edema (20%), although half of the corneal edema cases were likely due to pre-existing causes other than the aqueous shunt. The incidence of tube erosion was 1% and 3% in the Ahmed Glaucoma Valve and Baerveldt Glaucoma Implant groups, respectively (P = .04).",RESULTS
1177,"Visual field decay showed greater correlation to IOP variation (range and peak) and mean IOP than IOP at start or degree of IOP reduction. The relation between mean IOP and visual field decay in the whole group was not quite linear, with more decay at higher IOP levels. The association between IOP regulation and visual field decay was most pronounced in capsular glaucoma, whereas the results in the small group of simple glaucomas were inconclusive.",RESULTS
1178,Six IOP parameters were evaluated and correlated to visual field outcome. The subgroups with the two types of glaucoma (capsular and simple) were analyzed separately.,METHODS

1184,"Mean baseline IOP was 24.0+/-2.0 mmHg in the viscocanalostomy group and 23.7+/-2.6 mmHg in the trabeculectomy group (P = 0.7). Mean postoperative IOP was 13.7+/-2.2 mmHg at 3 months, 14.8+/-3.3 mmHg at 6 months, and 14.9+/-3.0 mmHg at 12 months in the viscocanalostomy group and 12.1+/-4.0 mmHg at 3 months, 13.8+/-4.7 mmHg at 6 months, and 14.1+/-4.4 mmHg at 12 months in the trabeculectomy group. There was no significant difference in the mean IOP between the groups at any time. At 12 months, 17 patients (85%) in the viscocanalostomy group and 16 patients (80%) in the trabeculectomy group achieved an IOP of 20 mmHg or less without medication (P = 0.7). Complications included 2 cases (10%) of flat/shallow anterior chamber and 4 cases (20%) of hypotony in the trabeculectomy group, whereas intraoperative microperforation of Descemet's membrane occurred in 3 cases (15%) in the viscocanalostomy group.",RESULTS

1195,"The primary efficacy analysis was based on the modified intent-to-treat population. At month 3, hour 2, the dorzolamide/timolol group had an adjusted mean (standard error) change in IOP of -5.04 (0.30) mmHg versus -5.41 (0.30) mmHg in the brimonidine + timolol group, with a treatment difference of 0.36 (0.40) mmHg (95% confidence interval [CI] of -0.42-1.14 mmHg). At month 3, hour 0, the dorzolamide/timolol group had a change in IOP of -3.66 (0.29) mmHg versus -4.15 (0.28) mmHg in the brimonidine + timolol group, with a treatment difference of 0.49 (0.39) mmHg (95% CI of -0.27-1.25 mmHg). Likewise, at all other observed time points, the 95% confidence interval of the treatment difference was within +/- 1.5 mmHg. Ninety-three patients (64%) in the dorzolamide/timolol group and 88 patients (60%) in the brimonidine + timolol group had adverse experiences that were deemed drug related by the investigator, for which 7 patients (5%) in the dorzolamide/timolol group and 8 patients (5%) in the brimonidine + timolol group were discontinued from the study.",RESULTS
1196,"The primary efficacy measure was unmedicated IOP ≤21 mmHg at 1 year. A secondary measure was unmedicated IOP reduction ≥20% at 1 year. Safety measures included best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), slit-lamp observations, complications, and adverse events.",METHODS

1207,"Trabeculectomy and tube shunt surgery had similar impact on patient-reported vision-specific QoL measured using the NEI VFQ-25. In this cohort of patients with advanced glaucoma, MIDs varied depending on the clinical anchor used. Distribution-based MIDs corresponded well with anchor-based MIDs based on VA measures. The MID values reported here may be useful for others wishing to interpret NEI VFQ-25 scores in their advanced glaucoma patient cohort.",CONCLUSIONS
1208,"Thirty-three patients completed the study. On the last day of treatment, the mean diurnal intraocular pressure for latanoprost was 15.9 +/- 2.3 mmHg and for TDFC was 15.3 +/- 2.0 mmHg (P = 0.05). Individual time points for intraocular pressure were not statistically different between groups except at the 10:00 PM time point, when the mean for TDFC was 14.6 +/- 2.7 mmHg and for latanoprost was 16.6 +/- 3.1 mmHg (P < 0.006). Eighteen patients overall preferred latanoprost versus 2 patients for the fixed combination, generally because of the greater convenience of once daily dosing. Adverse events were not significantly different between groups except that a bitter taste was found more frequently with TDFC (n = 9) than with latanoprost (n = 0; P = 0.009). Despite screening to exclude intolerance to beta-blockers, a single patient had to discontinue the TDFC because of new-onset asthma.",RESULTS
1209,"Surgical success was defined as (1) a complete success if the intraocular pressure (IOP) was 21 mmHg or less without any antiglaucoma medication, and (2) a qualified success if the IOP was 21 mmHg or less, with or without antiglaucoma medication. Patients requiring additional surgery, including needling, or with IOP more than 21 mmHg, even when receiving antiglaucoma medications, were considered to have failed treatment. Success rates in both groups were compared using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and the log-rank test. The morphologic characteristics of the filtering blebs were evaluated using the Indiana Bleb Appearance Grading Scale. Other outcome measures were IOP, visual acuity, need for antiglaucoma medication, and any complications.",METHODS
1210,"The evaluable PK analysis set included data from 39 of 47 enrolled subjects.

The study was closed for futility at a planned interim analysis. Overall survival was not significantly different between the groups (hazard ratio [HR], 0.87; 95% CI, 0.66-1.16; P = .34). Median survival was 10 months (95% CI, 8.0-14.4 months) in the nivolumab/ipilimumab group and 11 months (95% CI, 8.6-13.7 months) in the nivolumab group. The IA-PFS HR was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.61-1.03; P = .09); median IA-PFS was 3.8 months (95% CI, 2.7-4.4 months) in the nivolumab/ipilimumab group and 2.9 months (95% CI, 1.8-4.0 months) in the nivolumab alone group.
